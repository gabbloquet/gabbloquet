### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am deeply passionate about quality, architecture, technical debates, functional approach, Separation of concerns, reusability... (Everything which can permite to involve code quality, comprehension, readability).  
**In few words** : *Software Craftsmanship practices* ðŸ™‚

In a team, i can describe myself as someone focus on the need and close to the users, that brings ideas, who is not afraid to give his point of view and think outside the box. I love work in a good atmosphere, help my teammates, share my knowledge, carry interesting topics...

The goal is to give them the possibility to make the best possible business decisions by giving them interesting figures. In addition, they can place orders, manage store parameters, track stocks...
- **Front-end community Leader** : in few words I synergize, accompany, organize different events, help people who request it, give meaning and make the community's projects come true. Like [Vitamin](https://github.com/Decathlon/vitamin-web).
- **Decathlon Cloud Platform Engineering member** : Finally, with a group of 1X experts, we are thinking about tomorrow's IT at Decathlon. With the aim of removing burdens on engineering teams and let them focus on business added functionalities.
